Q.1) Write a PHP script to display source code of a webpage. 
<?php
// Read all lines from the specified URL and store them in an array
$all_lines = file('https://www.w3resource.com/');

// Iterate through each line in the array
foreach ($all_lines as $line_num => $line)
{
    // Display the line number and the HTML-escaped content of the line
    echo "Line No.-{$line_num}: " . htmlspecialchars($line) . "\n";
}
?>

Q.2) Write a PHP script to accept the number from user and Write a PHP function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.
# Define a function named 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a number 'n'
def factorial(n):
    # Check if the number 'n' is 0
    if n == 0:
        # If 'n' is 0, return 1 (factorial of 0 is 1)
        return 1
    else:
        # If 'n' is not 0, recursively call the 'factorial' function with (n-1) and multiply it with 'n'
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Ask the user to input a number to compute its factorial and store it in variable 'n'
n = int(input("Input a number to compute the factorial: "))

# Print the factorial of the number entered by the user by calling the 'factorial' function
print(factorial(n))
