Q.2) Consider the following entities and their relationship.
Student ( stud_id, name, class)
Competition(c_no,c_name, type)
a) Relationship between student and competition In many-many with attributes rank and year.
b) Create a RDB in 3NF for above and solve the following.
c) Using above database write a script in PHP to accept a competition from user and display
information of student who has secured 1st rank in that competition.
<?php
// Establish a database connection
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "your_database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Process the form submission
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Get the competition selected by the user
    $competition = $_POST["competition"];

    // Query to retrieve information about the student who secured 1st rank in the selected competition
    $sql = "SELECT Student.stud_id, Student.name, Student.class
            FROM Student
            INNER JOIN Student_Competition ON Student.stud_id = Student_Competition.stud_id
            INNER JOIN Competition ON Student_Competition.c_no = Competition.c_no
            WHERE Competition.c_name = '$competition' AND Student_Competition.rank = 1";

    $result = $conn->query($sql);

    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
        // Output data of each row
        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            echo "Student ID: " . $row["stud_id"] . " - Name: " . $row["name"] . " - Class: " . $row["class"] . "<br>";
        }
    } else {
        echo "No student secured 1st rank in the selected competition.";
    }
}

// Close the database connection
$conn->close();
?>
